image::doc/img/dapla-white.png[Dalpa,256]

This project aggregates dapla sources into a common development context.

== Make targets

Run `make help` to see common commands.

```
update-all                     Checkout or update all related dapla repos
print-local-changes            Show a brief summary of local changes
```
When running the contents of `update-all` on windows you may experience problems related to how git is configured to handle line endings.
The default is CRLF. To change settings:

. open up the file PATH-TO-GIT/git/etc/gitconfig
. find the field `autocrlf=true` and change it to `autocrlf=input`

If you have previously cloned the repo, you must clone it again for the changes to take effect

== Development Environment

The provided "umbrella" `pom.xml` in this project allows you to conveniently open all dapla projects in your IDE.
